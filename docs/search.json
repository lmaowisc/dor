    "text": "This R-code implements the analysis of duration-of-response data described in Mao et al. (2024) for oncology studies .\n\nBackground\nDuration-of-response (DOR) is often utilized to assess efficacy of oncology therapies. While valid procedures are available for estimating the mean (Huang et al. 2018), it is unclear how to estimate the distribution of DOR, which provides a fuller picture of patient experience. Using simple Kaplan–Meier estimates based on the responders can result in distorted conclusions due to the existence of non-responders (whose DOR is zero).\n\n\nNotation and Methodology\nFor a responder, let \\(T_1\\) denote the time to response. Let \\(T_2\\) denote the time to disease progression or death. If a patient experiences progression/death first, then \\(T_1=\\infty\\). The DOR can be defined as \\([T_2-T_1]_+\\), where \\(x_+=xI(x&gt;0).\\) Thus, DOR is \\(T_2-T_1\\) for responders, i.e., those with \\(T_1&lt;\\infty\\), and 0 for nonresponders. For notational convenience, set \\(T_1=T_2\\) for nonresponders.\n\n\nUsage and Example\n\nR-program\nTo use the program, download DORfunctions.R from https://github.com/lmaowisc/dor. The file contains all functions needed to perform the analysis.\n\nsource(\"DORfunctions.R\")\n\nThe main function is dorfit(x1, delta1, x2, delta2, tau, med_inf = FALSE).\nInput\n\nx1 time to earliest of response, outcome event, or censoring\ndelta1 indicator of response\nx2 time to earlier of outcome event and censoring\ndelta2 indicator of outcome event\ntau restriction time\nmed_inf whether to make inference on the median DOR\n\noutput\n\nx1 time to earliest of response, outcome event, or censoring\ndelta1 indicator of response\nx2 time to earlier of outcome event and censoring\n\n\n\nA simulated example\nss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHuang, Bo, Lu Tian, Enayet Talukder, Mace Rothenberg, Dae Hyun Kim, and Lee-Jen Wei. 2018. “Evaluating Treatment Effect Based on Duration of Response for a Comparative Oncology Study.” JAMA Oncology 4 (6): 874. https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.0275.\n\n\nMao, Lu, Lu Tian, Bo Huang, Paul G.
